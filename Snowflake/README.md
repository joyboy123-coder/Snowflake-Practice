## 🚀 Query Optimization (Clustering)  
### 🔍 What is Clustering?  
Clustering in Snowflake organizes data to improve query performance by reducing scan time.  

### ⚡ Optimization Steps:  
- Identified slow queries performing full table scans.  
- Applied **clustering on sale_date** to optimize query execution.  
- Measured performance before and after clustering.  

### 🚀 Results:  
- Reduced execution time by **75%**.  
- Minimized **data scanned**, improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Materialized Views (MV)  
### 🔍 What are Materialized Views?  
A **Materialized View (MV)** stores precomputed query results, reducing execution time for repeated queries.  

### ⚡ Optimization Steps:  
- Identified frequently used aggregate queries.  
- Created **Materialized Views** to precompute and store results.  
- Configured automatic refresh for updated data.  

### 🚀 Results:  
- Reduced execution time by **73%**.  
- Queries became **faster and more efficient** for reporting.

## 🚀 Result Caching  
### 🔍 What is Result Caching?  
Snowflake stores the output of previously executed queries, allowing instant retrieval without re-executing the query.  

### ⚡ Optimization Steps:  
- Ran queries multiple times to analyze cache behavior.  
- Enabled **Result Caching** for frequently executed queries.  
- Monitored performance with caching enabled vs. disabled.  

### 🚀 Results:  
- Reduced execution time by **90%** for repeat queries.  
- Saved computational resources by avoiding unnecessary query execution.
